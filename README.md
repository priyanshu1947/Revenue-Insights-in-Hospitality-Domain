## Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

Task:  

You are a data analyst who has been provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following task. You can download all relevant documents from the download section.

Create the metrics according to the metric list.
Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.

# Steps followed 



----->Data Loading and Power Query Documentation ------>


1. Create a folder in Desktop and store all the csv files related to hospitality challenge.

2. Open a Power BI file, and In "Get Data", select the option as folder and browse through the folder containing csv files.

3. Then go to Tranform data to expand each and every dataset.

4. Now, duplicate the data source 4 times and in each one, expand one dataset by clicking on "Binary" option. also, rename 
   the tables accordingly.


*****************  Power Query steps for tables:  *******************
1. dim_date:
	- remove the column 'day_type'
	- we are deleting this because, we got a feedback from the mock dashboard review that Friday and Saturday are           
	  considered as weekends in the industry and not sunday. But In our datasets, saturday and sunday are considered           
	  as weekends. So we delete this column and re-create day_type using calculated columns.

2. dim_rooms
	- The column names are not captured here. We need to select "Use First Row as Headers" option .

# Week-on-Week (Metrics used)

(WoW) is a type of business metric that measures changes in a specific variable
over a period of one week compared to the previous week. It is a common way of tracking
business performance over time and is particularly useful for analyzing trends and identifying
areas where improvements can be made.
Here are the metrics for which we found the WoW change% in this video:
1. Revenue WoW change %: To get the revenue change percentage week over week.
2. Occupancy WoW change %: To get the occupancy change percentage week over week.
3. ADR WoW change %: To get the ADR (Average Daily rate) change percentage week over week.
4. RevPAR WoW change %: To get the RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room) change percentage week over week.
5. Realisation WoW change %: To get the Realisation change percentage week over week.
6. DSRN WoW change %: To get the DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights) change percentage week over week.


* Let’s understand WoW change% for Revenue metric as an example:

Let’s break down this formula:

    Var selv = IF(HASONEFILTER(dim_date[wn]), SELECTEDVALUE(dim_date[wn]),MAX(dim_date[wn]))

This line creates a variable named selv. It checks if there is only one filter applied to the
dim_date[wn] column. If there is only one filter, it uses the selected value of that filter;
otherwise, it uses the maximum value of the dim_date[wn] column.

    var revcw = CALCULATE([Revenue],dim_date[wn]= selv)

This line creates a variable named revcw. It calculates the revenue by applying a filter on the
dim_date[wn] column, where the value matches the one stored in the selv variable. The
[Revenue] measure is used for this calculation.

    Var revpw = CALCULATE([Revenue],FILTER(ALL(dim_date),dim_date[wn]= selv-1))
This line creates a variable named revpw. It calculates the revenue for the previous week by
applying a filter on the dim_date[wn] column, where the value is one less than the one stored in
the selv variable. The FILTER function combined with ALL(dim_date) ensures that the filter is
applied to all the dates, regardless of other filters that might be active. The [Revenue] measure
is used for this calculation.

    DIVIDE (revcw, revpw,0)-1
This line calculates the percentage change in revenue WoW. It uses the DIVIDE function to divide
the value of revcw (current week revenue) by the value of revpw (previous week revenue), with
a specified default value of 0 in case the divisor is 0. The resulting quotient is then subtracted by
1 to calculate the percentage change.

The entire formula returns the week-over-week percentage change in revenue. This formula can
be used as a calculated column or a measure in Power BI to display the WoW revenue change in
a visual or table.
